This is a work in progres but functional GUI app to translate text to morse code and vice versa.

Since WIP, the app is in Czech, so are some of the code comments. I can translate it, if you're interested.

For it to work, you'll need the gui.py and morse.py files. Main.py has no real function yet. To run it, run gui.py or main.py in Python 3.6 or higher. It should not require any non-built-in modules.

How to use: 
	Write text or morse code to the upper textbox and click "Přelož". Text will be translated to morse code, morse code will be translated to uppercase text. You can edit the output in the output window. If you want to save the output, write the desired filename in the low-most box and click "Uložit". Text file will be created in the folder with the Morse app.

Upcoming features:
	- possibility to load message to translate from file
	- automatically copy the output to clipboard
	- possibility to create audiofile from created morse code

Further documentation will be added.
